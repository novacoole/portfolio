This is my placeholder portfolio website. The purpose of this site is to advertise myself to potential employers and collaboraters.
It has a very basic layout, with the majority of content (about me, skills, projects, contact) on one page seperated into \<div> sections. The blog list and blog pages have been created as seperate html documents.

The site is comprised of html and css documents. I utilised flexbox and css-grid to position most elements and to create some 'card' sections. I attempted some basic css animation in an attempt to "beautify" the page. I have used netlify to deploy my site via github.
